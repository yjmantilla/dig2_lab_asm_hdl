This is a text that you can use to test the
consoleecho program written for the LC3 processor
running on the FPGA.

Please check that you can read this text entirely
in cutecom display. If there are missing characters,
please increase the Char delay as there could be some
issues with the auto-speed detector inside the Serial 
(UART) module preventing the system to detect the
appropriate speed.

Thank you
